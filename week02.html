    <p>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was jointly awarded on Wednesday</p>
    <p>to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna for their 2012</p>
    <p>work on Crispr-Cas9, a method to edit DNA. The announcement</p>
    <p>marks the first time the award has gone to two women</p>

    <p>“This year’s prize is about rewriting the code of life,” Goran K.</p>
    <p>Hansson, the secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of</p>
    <p>Sciences, said as he announced the names of the laureates.</p>
    <p>Dr. Charpentier and Dr. Doudna, only the sixth and seventh women</p>
    <p>in history to win a chemistry prize, did much of the pioneering</p>
    <p>work to turn molecules made by microbes into a tool for</p>
    <p>customizing genes — whether in microbes, plants, animals or even</p>
    <p>humans.</p>
    <p>“I’m over the moon, I’m in shock,” Dr. Doudna, a professor at the</p>
    <p>University of California, Berkeley, said at a news conference on</p>
    <p>Wednesday.</p>
    <p>It has been only eight years since Dr. Doudna and Dr. Charpentier</p>
    <p>— now the director of the Max Planck Unit for the Science of</p>
    <p>Pathogens in Berlin — co-authored their first paper demonstrating</p>
    <p>the power of Crispr-Cas9. Since then, the technology has exploded.</p>
    <p>Doctors are testing it as a cure for genetic disorders such as sickle</p>
    <p>cell disease and hereditary blindness. Plant scientists are using it</p>
    <p>to create new crops. Some researchers are even trying to use</p>
    <p>Crispr to bring species back from extinction.</p>
    <p>Along with these high-profile experiments, other scientists are</p>
    <p>using Crispr to ask fundamental questions about life, such as which</p>
    <p>genes are essential to a cell’s survival. Crispr “solves problems in</p>
    <p>every field of biology,” said Angela Zhou, an information scientist at</p>
    <p>CAS, a division of the American Chemical Society.</p>
    <p>“This technology has utterly transformed the way we do research</p>
    <p>in basic science,” said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National</p>
    <p>Institutes of Health. “I am thrilled to see Crispr-Cas getting the</p>
    <p>recognition we have all been waiting for, and seeing two women</p>
    <p>being recognized as Nobel Laureates.”</p>
    <p>Crispr has also become one of the most controversial</p>
    <p>developments in science because of its potential to alter human</p>
    <p>heredity. In 2018, He Jiankui, a Chinese scientist, announced that</p>
    <p>he had used the technology to edit the genes of human embryos,</p>
    <p>which yielded the world’s first genetically modified infants. Dr. He’s</p>
    <p>experiments were decried by many in the scientific community as</p>
    <p>irresponsible and dangerous.</p>
    <p>“There is enormous power in this genetic tool which affects us all,”</p>
    <p>said Claes Gustafsson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.</p>

    <p>gene editing.</p>
    <p>Dr. Charpentier and Dr. Doudna both stumbled across Crispr by</p>
    <p>accident. Dr. Charpentier, a microbiologist, spent a number of years</p>
    <p>studying Streptococcus pyogenes, a species of bacteria that causes</p>
    <p>scarlet fever and other diseases. Inspecting the microbe’s DNA in</p>
    <p>2006, she and her colleagues discovered a puzzling series of</p>
    <p>repeating segments.</p>
    <p>A few scientists had studied these segments since the 1980s, but no</p>
    <p>one was sure of their function. Francisco Mojica, a microbiologist at</p>
    <p>the University of Alicante in Spain, gave these DNA stretches a</p>
    <p>name in 2000: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic</p>
    <p>repeats, or Crispr for short.</p>
    <h3>The 2020 Nobel Prizes</h3>
    <p>Updated Oct. 12, 2020</p>
    <p>See all of the 2020 winners here.</p>
    <p>Drs. Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice received</p>
    <p>the prize for medicine for their discovery of the hepatitis C virus.</p>
    <p>Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez received the</p>
    <p>physics prize for their discoveries that have improved understanding</p>
    <p>of the universe, including work on black holes.</p>
    <p>Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna were awarded the</p>
    <p>chemistry prize for their work on genome editing</p>
    <p>The Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Louise Glück, the</p>
    <p>American poet.</p>
    <p>This year’s Peace Prize was awarded to the U.N.’s World Food Program.</p>
    <p>Two U.S. economists, Paul R. Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson, were</p>
    <p>awarded the Nobel in economic science for their work on auction</p>
    <p>theory.</p>
    <p>A few scientists had studied these segments since the 1980s, but no</p>
    <p>one was sure of their function. Francisco Mojica, a microbiologist at</p>
    <p>the University of Alicante in Spain, gave these DNA stretches a</p>
    <p>name in 2000: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic</p>
    <p>repeats, or Crispr for short.</p>
    <p>Dr. Mojica and other researchers spent the 1990s and early 2000s</p>
    <p>trying to determine why microbes had this mysterious repetitive</p>
    <p>DNA. It became clear that between these repeats were bits of</p>
    <p>genetic material derived from viruses that had tried to infect the</p>
    <p>bacteria. Somehow, the bacteria were grabbing bits of viral genes</p>
    <p>and storing them away. It was if they were creating an archive of</p>
    <p>past infections, which they could later use to defend against future</p>
    <p>attacks.</p>
    <p>Dr. Charpentier and her colleagues discovered some of the key</p>
    <p>steps by which the bacteria used this information to attack viruses.</p>
    <p>The bacteria made molecules of RNA — ribonucleic acid, a cousin</p>
    <p>of DNA — that recognized the genes of attacking viruses.</p>
    <p>After writing a paper on their discovery in 2011, Dr. Charpentier</p>
    <p>recognized she needed to collaborate with an expert on RNA</p>
    <p>molecules to make more progress. That expert was Dr. Doudna.</p>
    <p>Dr. Doudna (the first syllable rhymes with loud) had never heard</p>
    <p>of Crispr until another Berkeley scientist, microbiologist Jill</p>
    <p>Banfield, brought it to her attention in 2006. Until then, she had</p>
    <p>studied how bacteria make RNA molecules for other purposes,</p>
    <p>such as sensing the environment and silencing certain genes.</p>
    <p>Dr. Charpentier, 51, and Dr. Doudna, 56, met at a cafe in Puerto Rico</p>
    <p>in 2011 while attending a scientific conference and immediately</p>
    <p>started to collaborate on understanding how Crispr worked. Soon,</p>
    <p>they realized that they might be able to harness the RNA molecules</p>
    <p>to seek out and alter any piece of DNA.</p>
    <p>Bacteria defend themselves by using these molecules to recognize</p>
    <p>the genes of an attacking virus. The weaponry includes an enzyme</p>
    <p>called Cas9 that slices the viral genetic material.</p>
    <p>Dr. Charpentier and Dr. Doudna realized that they could synthesize</p>
    <p>a piece of RNA that targeted and chopped up not just a spot on a</p>
    <p>viral gene — but on any gene. In 2012, the scientists proved this</p>
    <p>concept could work.</p>
    <p>Crispr was not the first tool scientists invented to alter DNA. But</p>
    <p>previous methods were relatively crude, involving expensive,</p>
    <p>cumbersome machines and materials. Crispr could become a far</p>
    <p>more precise genetic surgery.</p>
    <p>If researchers used Crispr molecules to make cuts at two</p>
    <p>neighboring sites on a piece of DNA, for example, the DNA stretch</p>
    <p>would heal, sewing itself together without the sliced segment. It</p>
    <p>became possible to insert a new piece of DNA in the place of the</p>
    <p>removed one. Subsequent research revealed how to use Crispr to</p>
    <p>alter single genetic letters.</p>
    <p>“Other technologies sometimes take a couple of decades before</p>
    <p>they come into regular practice,” Dr. Collins said. Crispr’s rapid rise</p>
    <p>to near ubiquity, he added, “is remarkable.”</p>
    <p>Jinelle Wint, assistant dean for academic affairs at Stowers</p>
    <p>Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Mo., described this</p>
    <p>year’s prize as a “historic win,” both because of its recognition of a</p>
    <p>revolutionary advancement in biomedical science, as well as its</p>
    <p>championing of women scientists.</p>
    <p>Aspiring female scientists, Dr. Wint said, should be empowered to</p>
    <p>think “that they, too, can be in the next Nobel Prize winners of the</p>
    <p>future.”</p>
    <p>Following her 2011 and 2012 discoveries, Dr. Charpentier was told</p>
    <p>numerous times by colleagues that Crispr might be Nobel-worthy.</p>
    <p>But she had trouble internalizing it.</p>
    <p>“It’s something you hear, but you don’t completely connect,” she</p>
    <p>said in a news conference on Wednesday. When she received the</p>
    <p>call, “I was very emotional,” she said.</p>
    <p>Still, experts noted, women make up a paltry percentage of science</p>
    <p>laureates. Scientists of color, especially those who identify as Black,</p>
    <p>Latino, Native or Indigenous, have been almost entirely left out of</p>
    <p>the process.</p>
    <p>Early on, Dr. Charpentier and Dr. Doudna recognized the potential</p>
    <p>dangers of the technology that they helped usher into the world.</p>
    <p>Dr. Doudna left her lab and hit the lecture circuit. In 2017, she co-</p>
    <p>wrote a book, “A Crack in Creation” to describe both the promise</p>
    <p>and the peril of Crispr. Nevertheless, she was taken by surprise a</p>
    <p>year later when Dr. He announced his reckless experiment in</p>
    <p>China.</p>
    <p>“We as a community need to make sure we recognize we are taking</p>
    <p>charge of a very powerful technology,” Dr. Doudna said in an</p>
    <p>interview on Wednesday. “I hope this announcement galvanizes</p>
    <p>that intention.”</p>
    <p>Last month, an international committee concluded Crispr was not</p>
    <p>mature enough to use for the alteration of human embryos. But the</p>
    <p>committee did not rule out the possibility that Crispr could</p>
    <p>someday be used on rare occasions to repair life-threatening</p>
    <p>mutations.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know all the effects of tinkering with the human</p>
    <p>genome,” said Nita Farahany, a bioethics expert at Duke University</p>
    <p>in Durham, N.C. “A major advance can introduce major</p>
    <p>disruptions, and we need to decide how to embrace it in such a way</p>
    <p>that responsible science progresses.”</p>
    <p>Crispr is also the subject of a long-running patent fight. In 2011,</p>
    <p>Feng Zhang, a biologist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.,</p>
    <p>learned of Crispr and recognized that it might serve as a gene-</p>
    <p>editing tool.</p>
    <p>Eventually they ended up in court. While the Broad has won many</p>
    <p>of the legal battles, the matter remains unresolved.</p>
    <p>“It will be interesting to see if the award of the prize changes the</p>
    <p>parties’ interest in continuing to fight,” said Hank Greely, a</p>
    <p>professor of law and of genetics at Stanford University. Nothing</p>
    <p>about the Nobel changes the evidence at hand, he said. But it may</p>
    <p>“affect the motivations to spend millions of dollars a month.”</p>
    <p>In a news conference on Wednesday, Dr. Doudna looked past that</p>
    <p>conflict, instead focusing on the “collaborative spirit” that had</p>
    <p>driven much of her work with Crispr and acknowledging the many</p>
    <p>other scientists that had contributed to driving the field forward.</p>
    <p>“In any prize, you know, in any work of science, there are many</p>
    <p>people who contribute along the way,” she said. “And that’s</p>
    <p>certainly true in the case of Crispr.”</p>
    <p>After receiving word of the award early Wednesday, Dr. Doudna</p>
    <p>recalled telling her son, “None of us go into science, or at least I</p>
    <p>didn’t, to win prizes. We went in because we wanted to understand</p>
    <p>something true about nature.”</p>
    <h2>Who won the 2019 Nobel Prize for Chemistry?</h2>
    <p>John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino
    <p> were recognized for research on lithium-ion batteries that has “laid</p>
    <p>the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society,” according to</p>
    <p>the prize committee.</p>
    <img src="/images/nobelprizetop-videoLarge-v2.jpg" alt="photo of Akira Yoshino" >
    <h2>Who else won a Nobel Prize this year?</h2>
    <p>Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice received</p>
    <p>the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for the</p>
    <p>discovery of the hepatitis C virus, a breakthrough the Nobel</p>
    <p>committee said had “made possible blood tests and new</p>
    <p>medicines that have saved millions of lives.”</p>
    <p>Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez received the</p>
    <p>Physics prize on Tuesday for their discoveries that have</p>
    <p>improved understanding of the universe, including work on black holes</p>
    <h2>When will the other Nobel Prizes be announced?</h2>
    <p>The Nobel Prizes in Literature will be announced on Thursday in</p>
    <p>Sweden. The prizes for both 2018 and 2019 were announced last</p>
    <p>year after a postponement of the 2018 prize. That occurred after</p>
    <p>the husband of an academy member was accused, and ultimately</p>
    <p>convicted, of rape — a crisis that led to the departure of several</p>
    <p>board members and required the intervention of the King of</p>
    <p>Sweden.</p>
    <p>The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday in Norway</p>
    <p>Read about last year’s winner, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia.</p>
    <p>The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science will be</p>
    <p>announced Monday next week in Sweden. Read about last year’s</p>
    <p>winners, Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer.</p>
