        “This year’s prize is about rewriting the code of life,” Goran K.
        Hansson, the secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of
        Sciences, said as he announced the names of the laureates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr. Charpentier and Dr. Doudna, only the sixth and seventh women
        in history to win a chemistry prize, did much of the pioneering
        work to turn molecules made by microbes into a tool for
        customizing genes — whether in microbes, plants, animals or even
        humans.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I’m over the moon, I’m in shock,” Dr. Doudna, a professor at the
        University of California, Berkeley, said at a news conference on
        Wednesday.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has been only eight years since Dr. Doudna and Dr. Charpentier
        — now the director of the Max Planck Unit for the Science of<
        Pathogens in Berlin — co-authored their first<a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22745249/ target="_blank">paper</a> demonstrating
        the power of Crispr-Cas9. Since then, the technology has exploded.
        Doctors are testing it as a cure for genetic disorders such as sickle
        <a href=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/06/23/877543610/a-year-in-1st-patient-to-get-gene-editing-for-sickle-cell-disease-is-thriving target="_blank">cell disease</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00655-8" target="_blank">hereditary blindness</a>. Plant scientists are using it
        to create new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/science/groundcherries-crispr-gene-editing.html" target="_blank">crops</a>. Some researchers are even trying to use
        >Crispr to bring species <a href="https://reviverestore.org/projects/woolly-mammoth/progress/" target="_blank">back from extinction.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Along with these high-profile experiments, other scientists are
        using Crispr to ask fundamental questions about life, such as which
        genes are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/health/cancer-drugs-proteins.html" target="_blank">essential</a> to a cell’s survival. Crispr “solves problems in
        every field of biology,” said Angela Zhou, an information scientist at
        CAS, a division of the American Chemical Society.
    </p>
    <p>
        “This technology has utterly transformed the way we do research
        in basic science,” said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National
        Institutes of Health. “I am thrilled to see Crispr-Cas getting the
        recognition we have all been waiting for, and seeing two women
        being recognized as Nobel Laureates.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Crispr has also become one of the most controversial
        developments in science because of its potential to alter human
        heredity. In 2018, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/health/gene-editing-babies-china.html">He Jiankui, a Chinese scientist</a>, announced that
        he had used the technology to edit the genes of human embryos,
        which yielded the world’s first genetically modified infants. Dr. He’s
        experiments were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/world/asia/gene-editing-babies-he-jiankui.html" target="_blank">decried by many in the scientific community</a> as
        irresponsible and dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
        “There is enormous power in this genetic tool which affects us all,”
        said Claes Gustafsson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.
    </p>
    <p>
        “EDITING HUMANITY”<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/books/review/editing-humanity-kevin-davies.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article" target="_blank">Read Carl Zimmer’s review</a> of a new book on Crispr and</p>
        gene editing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr. Charpentier and Dr. Doudna both stumbled across Crispr by
        accident. Dr. Charpentier, a microbiologist, spent a number of years
        studying Streptococcus pyogenes, a species of bacteria that causes
        scarlet fever and other diseases. Inspecting the microbe’s DNA in
        2006, she and her colleagues discovered a puzzling series of
        repeating segments.
    </p>
    <p>
        A few scientists had studied these segments since the 1980s, but no
        one was sure of their function. Francisco Mojica, a microbiologist at
        the University of Alicante in Spain, gave these DNA stretches a
        name in 2000: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
        repeats, or Crispr for short.

    <p>theory.</p>
    <p>A few scientists had studied these segments since the 1980s, but no</p>
    <p>one was sure of their function. Francisco Mojica, a microbiologist at</p>
    <p>the University of Alicante in Spain, gave these DNA stretches a</p>
    <p>name in 2000: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic</p>
    <p>repeats, or Crispr for short.</p>
    <p>
        Dr. Mojica and other researchers spent the 1990s and early 2000s
        trying to determine why microbes had this mysterious repetitive
        DNA. It became clear that between these repeats were bits of
        genetic material derived from viruses that had tried to infect the
        bacteria. Somehow, the bacteria were grabbing bits of viral genes
        and storing them away. It was if they were creating an archive of
        past infections, which they could later use to defend against future
        attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr. Charpentier and her colleagues discovered some of the key
        steps by which the bacteria used this information to attack viruses.
        The bacteria made molecules of RNA — ribonucleic acid, a cousin
        of DNA — that recognized the genes of attacking viruses.
    </p>
    <p>
        After writing a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3070239/" target="_blank">paper</a> on their discovery in 2011, Dr. Charpentier   
        recognized she needed to collaborate with an expert on RNA
        molecules to make more progress. That expert was Dr. Doudna.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr. Doudna (the first syllable rhymes with loud) had never heard    
        of Crispr until another Berkeley scientist, microbiologist Jill 
        Banfield, brought it to her attention in 2006. Until then, she had
        studied how bacteria make RNA molecules for other purposes,
        such as sensing the environment and silencing certain genes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr. Charpentier, 51, and Dr. Doudna, 56, met at a cafe in Puerto Rico
        in 2011 while attending a scientific conference and immediately
        started to collaborate on understanding how Crispr worked. Soon,
        they realized that they might be able to harness the RNA molecules
        to seek out and alter any piece of DNA.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bacteria defend themselves by using these molecules to recognize    
        the genes of an attacking virus. The weaponry includes an enzyme
        called Cas9 that slices the viral genetic material.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr. Charpentier and Dr. Doudna realized that they could synthesize
        a piece of RNA that targeted and chopped up not just a spot on a
        viral gene — but on any gene. In 2012, the scientists <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6096/816.abstract?casa_token=gKpPo-G8hC0AAAAA:3fhbo-8MiJjXkbcBreqcLIXQH8mgoqawwTC1JhXKT6chCvgC8MHM60jDg4PGh3ijozm-1nnm94z6WQ" target="_blank">proved</a> this
        concept could work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Crispr was not the first tool scientists invented to alter DNA. But 
        previous methods were relatively crude, involving expensive,    
        cumbersome machines and materials. Crispr could become a far
        more precise genetic surgery.
    </p>
    <p>
        If researchers used Crispr molecules to make cuts at two
        neighboring sites on a piece of DNA, for example, the DNA stretch
        would heal, sewing itself together without the sliced segment. It
        became possible to insert a new piece of DNA in the place of the
        removed one. Subsequent research revealed how to use Crispr to
        alter single genetic letters.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Other technologies sometimes take a couple of decades before   
        they come into regular practice,” Dr. Collins said. Crispr’s rapid rise
        to near ubiquity, he added, “is remarkable.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Jinelle Wint, assistant dean for academic affairs at Stowers    
        Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Mo., described this
        year’s prize as a “historic win,” both because of its recognition of a
        revolutionary advancement in biomedical science, as well as its
        championing of women scientists.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aspiring female scientists, Dr. Wint said, should be empowered to
        think “that they, too, can be in the next Nobel Prize winners of the
        future.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Following her 2011 and 2012 discoveries, Dr. Charpentier was told
    numerous times by colleagues that Crispr might be Nobel-worthy.
    But she had trouble internalizing it.
    </p>
    <p>
        “It’s something you hear, but you don’t completely connect,” she
        said in a news conference on Wednesday. When she received the
        call, “I was very emotional,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
        Still, experts noted, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/science/nobel-prize-women-speeches.html" target="blank">women make up a paltry percentage of science</a>
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/science/nobel-prize-women-speeches.html" target="blank">laureates</a>. Scientists of color, especially those who identify as Black,
        Latino, Native or Indigenous, have been almost entirely left out of
        the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Early on, Dr. Charpentier and Dr. Doudna recognized the potential
        dangers of the technology that they helped usher into the world.
        Dr. Doudna left her lab and hit the lecture circuit. In 2017, she co-
        wrote a book, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Crack_in_Creation.html?id=F8WlDAAAQBAJ" target="_blank">“A Crack in Creation”</a> to describe both the promise
        and the peril of Crispr. Nevertheless, she was taken by surprise a
        year later when Dr. He announced his reckless experiment in
        China.
    </p>
    <p>
        “We as a community need to make sure we recognize we are taking
        charge of a very powerful technology,” Dr. Doudna said in an
        interview on Wednesday. “I hope this announcement galvanizes
        that intention.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Last month, an international committee <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/commission-charts-narrow-path-editing-human-embryos" target="_blank">concluded</a> Crispr was not
        mature enough to use for the alteration of human embryos. But the
        committee did not rule out the possibility that Crispr could
        someday be used on rare occasions to repair life-threatening
        mutations.
    </p>
    <p>
        “We don’t know all the effects of tinkering with the human
        genome,” said Nita Farahany, a bioethics expert at Duke University
        in Durham, N.C. “A major advance can introduce major
        disruptions, and we need to decide how to embrace it in such a way
        that responsible science progresses.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Crispr is also the subject of a long-running patent fight. In 2011,
        Feng Zhang, a biologist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.,
        learned of Crispr and recognized that it might serve as a gene-
        editing tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually they ended up in court. While the Broad has won many
        of the legal battles, the matter remains unresolved.
    </p>
    <p>
        “It will be interesting to see if the award of the prize changes the
        parties’ interest in continuing to fight,” said Hank Greely, a
        professor of law and of genetics at Stanford University. Nothing
        about the Nobel changes the evidence at hand, he said. But it may
        “affect the motivations to spend millions of dollars a month.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a news conference on Wednesday, Dr. Doudna looked past that
        conflict, instead focusing on the “collaborative spirit” that had
        driven much of her work with Crispr and acknowledging the many
        other scientists that had contributed to driving the field forward.
     </p>
        “In any prize, you know, in any work of science, there are many
        people who contribute along the way,” she said. “And that’s
        certainly true in the case of Crispr.”
    </p>
    <p>
        After receiving word of the award early Wednesday, Dr. Doudna
        recalled telling her son, “None of us go into science, or at least I
        didn’t, to win prizes. We went in because we wanted to understand
        something true about nature.”
